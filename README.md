This is my personal i3 status bar.
Feel free to use it, but don't complain that it's not working for you.

The code is really ugly so don't look too close.
There is no configuration file, if you have any improvements, feel free to make a PR.

**This project was replaced by a [full Rust rewrite](https://github.com/dasJ/statusbar-rs)**
